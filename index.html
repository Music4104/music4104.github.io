<h1>Stray by BlueTwelve Studio</h1>
<p>See a whole new world through the eyes of an orange tabby cat that falls into the walls of a cyborg city that is removed from all organic and human life forms. 
  Stray is an adventure puzzle game that allows players to explore this underground city run by robots in search for a way back to the surface. Along the way, players 
  can meow, purr, and scratch the furniture of the robots that have made this underground place their home.</p>
<p>According to an interview with the sound designers of Stray, building the sounds of the Dead City involved gathering components of city sounds from Japan, France, 
  and Korea and removing the human elements. Then, some of these tones and sounds were altered to invoke a futuristic or mechanical feeling. Take a listen to this clip 
  from the game and see what elements you can pick up on:</p>
<p>Next, take a listen to the music that is presented in different areas of the game:</p>
<p>This music evokes a feeling of curiosity and exploration. Stray is all about exploring your surroundings, solving puzzles, and learning about the world that you have 
  found yourself in. Combining both the natural ambiance and the background music creates an immersive environment for players to feel as if the world they are traversing is real.</p>
